# Dungeon-Knightmare
A first attempt at building a platformer using pygame.

This is a personal project that I wanted to create so I could start learning game development.
The game is WIP as I have not added other things like animations, audio, a menu, other levels, etc.

Controls: Move - Left and right arrow keys, Jump - Up arrow key, Attack - X
  
To Win: Defeat the boss at the end of the stage.
