# Dungeon-Knightmare
A first attempt at building a platformer using pygame.

This is a personal project that I wanted to create so I could start learning game development.
The game is WIP as I have not added things like animations, audio, improved art, a menu, other levels, etc.

To play the game, run the Dungeon-Knightmare.exe file in the Dungeon-Knightmare directory.
A video demo of the gameplay is also included in this repository.

Controls: Move - left and right arrow keys, Jump - up arrow key, Attack - x
  
To Win: Defeat the boss at the end of the stage.
